To run this React app you will need to do an npm install in the top-level folder and the client folder. Then run webpack and node server.js

This app was created during a CodeClan lab/homework aimed at allowing us to practice what we have learnt about React so far. 

Using the football data api (http://api.football-data.org/documentation) the user is able to pick a Premiership team from a dropdown list. A dropdown list then appears with that team's players allowing the user to click on a player and get some more details about them.

The app also displays the fixtures for the selected team, splitting them into results for the matches that have been played and fixtures for those to come, with scores provided for the results.
